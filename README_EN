## About me  
I am a Higher Vocational Training (FP) student in Computer Science (ASIR), with a special interest in Big Data and Artificial Intelligence.  
My interest in the world of data began during the Databases course in my first year of ASIR, where I discovered how much I enjoy working with SQL, MongoDB, and data modeling.  

I am passionate about:  
- Automating processes.  
- Designing queries and optimizing databases.  
- Transforming data into useful and visual information.
